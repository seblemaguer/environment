* Global overview
This is my (Sébounet!) environement configuration repository. Everything means to be as automatic as
possible and as unix platform independent as possible (mac and linux supported but not windows !)

* Architecture
The architecture respect the following paradigm :
#+begin_example
<environment_root>
     |
     +--- bootstrap.sh
     |
     +--- install.sh
     |
     +--- local
     |     |
     |     +----- bin
     |     |
     |     +----- include
     |     |
     |     +----- lib
     |     |
     |     +----- ...
     |
     +--- src
     |     |
     |     |
     |     +----- 00-system
     |     |
     |     +----- ...
#+end_example

- *bootstrap.sh* resets the environment by delete *local* and calling *install.sh*
- *install.sh* contains the installation process
- *local* contains the local environment. It is a replicate of the /usr linux architecture
- *src* contains all submodules or dedicated source kit. In order to add a new tool you need to
  create a dedicated directory which contains :
  + *install.sh* for the dedicated installation procedure
  + *<directory>* which contains the submodule of the dedicated tool or a specific source directory
    if there is not any submodule available
